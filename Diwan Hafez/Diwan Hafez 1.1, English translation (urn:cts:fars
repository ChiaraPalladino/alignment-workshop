Diwan Hafez 1.1, English translation (urn:cts:farsiLit:hafez.divan.perseus-eng1:1.1)

[1]  Ho Saki ,pass around and offer the bowl of love for God 
For the burden of love for God at first on the day of covenant appeared easy ,but now difficulties have occurred .
[2]   By reason of the perfume hope of the musk - pod ,that ,at the end of night the breeze displayeth from that knotted fore - lock ,
From the twist of its musky dark ,fragrant curl ,what blood of grief befell the hearts of the lovers of God
[3]   In the stage this world of the true Beloved ,mine what ease and pleasure ,when momently ,
The loud bell of the call of death giveth voice ,saying Bind ye up the chattels of existence
[4]   With wine ,becolour the prayer - mat if the Pir of the magians the perfect murshid bid thee 
For of the way and usage of the stages to God not without knowledge is the holy traveller the perfect murshid
[5]   The dark night of the world and the fear of the wave of grief and the whirlpool so fearful the time of death
The light - burdened ones of the shore ancestors who have passed the flood of death how know they our state
[6]   By following my own fancy in hastening to union with God me only to ill fame all my work brought 
Secret ,how remaineth that great mystery of love whereof great assemblies speak
[7]   Hafiz if thou desire the presence union with God Most High from Him be not absent 
When thou visitest thy Beloved ,abandon the world and let it go .
